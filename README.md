## AWS Amplify Next.js (App Router) Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using Next.js (App Router) and AWS Amplify with a minimal backend focused on authentication.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational Next.js application integrated with AWS Amplify. It keeps the configuration lightweight—only Amazon Cognito authentication is enabled by default—so you can add the APIs, databases, and other Amplify resources that your project needs.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.

## Customize the Backend

The backend has been pared down to the essentials. When you're ready to expand beyond authentication, run the Amplify CLI to add services such as Data (AppSync + DynamoDB), Functions, Storage, and more.

## Deploying to AWS

For detailed instructions on deploying your application, refer to the [deployment section](https://docs.amplify.aws/nextjs/start/quickstart/nextjs-app-router-client-components/#deploy-a-fullstack-app-to-aws) of our documentation.
